## ✨ Features & Architecture

### 1. 🎭 Dual-Role Authentication & Access Control
- **Yash Admin Studio**:
  - **Username:** `yash`
  - **Password:** `yashadmin123`
  - Access to the full Creator Studio: Multi-reel manager (add up to N reels, edit, batch upload, delete), direct replies inbox with context attribution, Glory login audit history, and Supabase cloud settings.
- **Glory VIP Experience**:
  - **Username:** `glory` (or `Glory`)
  - **Password:** `lory`
  - 5-second cinematic countdown sequence on sign-in, followed by an Instagram-style vertical reel feed with smooth 1-by-1 snapping transitions, floating cinema glass typography, sound toggles, and direct reply capability.

### 2. 🎬 Vertical Reel Feed (1-by-1 Instagram Experience)
- **Smooth 1-by-1 transitions**: Discrete wheel and touch-swipe physics snap directly to the next or previous reel without runaway scrolling.
- **Floating Cinema Glass Typography**: Pure luminous transparent glass text with deep drop-shadows floating over the video—**no box background, border, or card container**.
- **Click-to-Reveal Cinema Flow**: Reels first showcase the dramatic floating text; tapping reveals the centered theater stage and smoothly unpauses high-fidelity audio/video.
- **Optional Video Media**: Supports video reels (MP4, WebM) or pure text-only luxury cinema cards.

### 3. 🕒 Glory Login Audit History
- Automatically records the exact date, time, relative time (`Just now`, `5m ago`), and device type (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, browser) every time Glory signs in.
- Full audit list and last sign-in highlight card displayed in the Admin Dashboard.

### 4. 💌 Glory Direct Replies with Context
- When Glory replies from her feed, the message records the exact reel number, title, and quote preview so Yash knows exactly what reel inspired her response.

### 5. ☁️ Supabase Cloud Database & Storage
- **Dedicated Storage Bucket**: Consistently uses `reels-videos` for all media.
- **Supported Formats**: Strictly browser-compatible **MP4 (H.264 video + AAC audio)** and **WebM**. Incompatible legacy formats (MKV, AVI, 3GP, HEVC) are rejected upfront with decodability validation.
- **Size Validation**: Maximum 50MB per video with instant pre-upload size & metadata checks.
- **Atomic Upload & Database Consistency**: Video is uploaded first; if database insertion fails, the uploaded storage file is immediately deleted (rolled back). Old storage videos are only cleaned up after a replacement update succeeds.
- **Orphan Cleanup Utility**: Admin tool `window.__cleanupOrphanedVideos()` scans the storage bucket and purges unreferenced video files.
- **Realtime Synchronization**: Postgres changes on `reels` and `glory_replies` tables are subscribed via Supabase Realtime for instant multi-device live sync.
- Run `supabase_schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor for instantaneous table and storage bucket creation.

### 6. 🚀 Production Zero-Lag Streaming Server (`server.js`)
- Zero-dependency Node.js HTTP server supporting RFC 7233 HTTP Range requests (`206 Partial Content`) and `HEAD` requests for buffer-free video scrubbing and instant seeking on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, and desktop browsers.
- Intelligent preloading: Active reel uses `preload="auto"`, adjacent reels use `preload="metadata"`, and distant reels use `preload="none"`.
- Resilient playback with neon glass buffering spinner (`.reel-video-loader`), error boundary with instant retry, and mobile autoplay fallback.
